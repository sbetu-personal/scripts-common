### **Report: Analysis and Mitigation Plan for OS Families 2, 3, and 4 Retirement**

**Prepared by:** 
**Date:** 

#### **Background**
Microsoft has announced the retirement of OS Families 2, 3, and 4 in Cloud Services (Classic and Extended Support). Resources relying on these OS families need to be identified and migrated or updated to ensure continuity and security.

---

#### **1. Current Exposure**

**Scope of Impact:**
- **Virtual Machines (VMs):**  
   Initial analysis indicates potential usage of older OS families or unsupported OS versions. A detailed inventory is in progress to confirm affected VMs.

- **Cloud Services (Classic and Extended Support):**  
   Services running on deprecated OS families are at risk. Identification of these resources is ongoing.

**Key Dependencies:**
- Applications and workloads deployed on outdated OS versions or using affected cloud services.
- Networking components and integrations relying on these services.

---

#### **2. Mitigation Plan**

1. **Identification of Affected Resources:**
   - Use Azure Resource Graph and PowerShell scripts to extract data on OS families and versions.
   - Cross-reference against Azureâ€™s support matrix for deprecated OS families.

2. **Migration and Upgrade Strategy:**
   - Upgrade Cloud Services (Classic) to Cloud Services (Extended Support) where applicable.
   - For affected VMs, migrate to supported OS versions or families.

3. **Testing and Validation:**
   - Conduct thorough application testing on upgraded OS platforms.
   - Validate configurations, dependencies, and performance post-migration.

4. **Backup and Recovery:**
   - Create snapshots and backups before initiating migrations or upgrades.

#### **3. Timeline and Resources**

| Task                      | Timeline         | Owner            |
|---------------------------|------------------|------------------|
| Resource Identification   | [Insert Date]    | Azure Team       |
| Mitigation Plan Execution | [Insert Date]    | Azure Ops Team   |
| Testing and Validation    | [Insert Date]    | DevOps Team      |

---

#### **4. Recommendations**

1. Expedite resource inventory collection using the attached PowerShell script.
2. Schedule upgrades for affected resources before the retirement date.
3. Allocate resources for application testing and validation.

### **PowerShell Script**

The script below retrieves details of all VMs and Cloud Services in your subscriptions to help identify resources running outdated OS families.

```powershell
# Load Azure PowerShell module
Import-Module Az

# Authenticate to Azure
Connect-AzAccount

# Retrieve all subscriptions
$subscriptions = Get-AzSubscription

# Initialize an array to store details
$resourceDetails = @()

foreach ($subscription in $subscriptions) {
    # Set the subscription context
    Set-AzContext -SubscriptionId $subscription.Id

    # Get all VMs
    $vms = Get-AzVM -Status
    foreach ($vm in $vms) {
        $resourceDetails += [PSCustomObject]@{
            SubscriptionName = $subscription.Name
            ResourceType     = "Virtual Machine"
            ResourceGroup    = $vm.ResourceGroupName
            ResourceName     = $vm.Name
            Location         = $vm.Location
            OSType           = $vm.StorageProfile.OsDisk.OsType
            OSVersion        = $vm.OSVersion
            PowerState       = $vm.PowerState
        }
    }

    # Get all Cloud Services (Classic)
    $cloudServices = Get-AzCloudService
    foreach ($cs in $cloudServices) {
        $resourceDetails += [PSCustomObject]@{
            SubscriptionName = $subscription.Name
            ResourceType     = "Cloud Service (Classic)"
            ResourceGroup    = $cs.ResourceGroupName
            ResourceName     = $cs.Name
            Location         = $cs.Location
            OSFamily         = $cs.OsFamily
            OSVersion        = $cs.OsVersion
        }
    }
}

# Export to a CSV file
$resourceDetails | Export-Csv -Path "Azure_Resource_Exposure.csv" -NoTypeInformation -Encoding UTF8

# Display summary
$resourceDetails | Format-Table -AutoSize
```

---

### **Next Steps**

1. Run the script to collect resource data and review the `Azure_Resource_Exposure.csv` file for outdated OS families.
2. Update the report with findings and share it with stakeholders.
3. Initiate migration and upgrade actions as outlined in the mitigation plan.

Let me know if you need help tailoring this report further or debugging the script!
