**Subject:** Request to Enable Diagnostics and Create Log Analytics Workspace for Azure SQL MIs

**Hi [Manager’s Name],**

I hope you’re doing well. I’d like to recommend setting up a **Log Analytics Workspace (LAWS)** and configuring **Diagnostic settings** on all 13 of our Azure SQL Managed Instances. This would allow us to:

1. **Centralize Security Logs and Audit Data**  
   - Storing all audit logs, login attempts, and performance data in one place will greatly improve our ability to detect suspicious activity and ensure compliance.

2. **Identify Unused or Underutilized Instances**  
   - With Diagnostic logs in one workspace, we can quickly pinpoint any Managed Instances that are no longer in use or have minimal activity, helping us optimize costs.

**Current Situation**  
- We can see basic metrics (e.g., CPU) in the Azure Portal by default, but these do not include the detailed security and diagnostic logs we need for a thorough analysis and audit trail.
- Alternatively, we could log into each of the 13 servers individually and run T-SQL queries to check usage. However, that approach is cumbersome and doesn’t provide a centralized view, especially for security incident correlation or ongoing analytics.

**Proposed Solution**  
1. **Create a dedicated Log Analytics Workspace** (or leverage an existing suitable one, if we have it).  
2. **Enable Diagnostic settings** on each of the 13 Managed Instances, pointing all logs (SQLSecurityAuditEvents, ErrorLog, etc.) to the LAWS.  
3. **Validate data ingestion** by ensuring logs are flowing into the workspace and confirm that we can run KQL queries to analyze security, usage patterns, and performance across all instances.

**Benefits**  
- **Better Security Posture**: Faster detection of unauthorized logins or anomalies.  
- **Easier Compliance**: A unified log repository simplifies audits and reporting.  
- **Operational Efficiency**: We can quickly identify which instances are underutilized or inactive and take appropriate action.

Please let me know if you have any questions or concerns about this plan. I’m happy to provide more details on the setup process and the expected timeline.

Thank you for your consideration, and I look forward to hearing your thoughts.
