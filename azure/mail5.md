**Subject:** Request for Review: Orca Alerts on CBC-AWS-RDS-1  

Dear Storage Leads,  

We have identified Orca alerts on **CBC-AWS-RDS-1** related to the policy that **RDS must be encrypted at rest**. A total of **98 non-compliant instances** have been found across all our AWS accounts. Of these, **90 instances** are from **AwsRdsDbInstanceSnapshot**.  

We kindly request you to review these snapshots and take the necessary steps to bring them into compliance. Please let us know if you require additional information or assistance in addressing this issue.  

Looking forward to your action on this matter.  

Best regards,

Let me know if further adjustments are needed!

Proposed Resolution:
For the identified snapshots, create encrypted copies using the AWS RDS console or API, and ensure future snapshots are created from encrypted RDS instances to maintain compliance. Please let us know if you need any assistance in setting up the process.
