**Subject:** Setup of Log Analytics Workspace for Azure SQL MI Monitoring  

Hi [Recipient's Name],  

As discussed with Mark (Architect), I will be creating a dedicated Log Analytics Workspace (LAWS) in our Azure sandbox subscription. I will also configure diagnostic settings on all 13 of our Azure SQL Managed Instances to send logs to this LAWS.  

This setup will help us investigate the usage and audit user logins on these databases, allowing us to determine whether they are actively being used. Based on the insights, we can take necessary actions for cleanup.  

Once this analysis is complete, we will also clean up the LAWS or repurpose it for monitoring the usage of other Azure resources, similar to how we are doing for SQL.  

Let me know if you have any questions.  

Best,  
[Your Name]
