Below is a **complete Confluence page** you can use to document **CBC-AWS-EBS-2** (EBS volume encryption). This page includes **all** sections—summary, requirement details, Terraform references, **manual remediation** (including one-step vs. two-step approaches), SCP enforcement, verification, and references.

## **Page Title**  
**CBC-AWS-EBS-2: EBS Volume Encryption Must Be Enabled**

---

## 1. **Summary**

This requirement ensures that **all EBS volumes** storing data within AWS are **encrypted at rest**. Encrypting volumes is a key measure to protect data from unauthorized access if the underlying storage is compromised (e.g., lost, stolen, or accessed by an unauthorized party).

---

## 2. **Requirement Details**

- **Requirement**: Every EBS volume (new or existing) **must** be encrypted.  
- **Why**:  
  - Encryption at rest is a standard security control under various compliance frameworks (PCI DSS, HIPAA, etc.).  
  - It prevents plaintext data from being read if the physical media is accessed outside of AWS.  
- **Implications**:  
  - Any unencrypted volumes or snapshots in the environment are considered **non-compliant** and must be remediated.  
  - For new volumes, always ensure encryption is enabled (via Terraform or console).  
  - For existing unencrypted volumes, you must migrate or recreate them in an encrypted format.

---

## 3. **Terraform Implementation**

If you manage EBS volumes with Terraform, add encryption parameters to your resource definitions:

```hcl
resource "aws_ebs_volume" "secure_volume" {
  availability_zone = var.default_az
  size             = 20
  encrypted        = true
  kms_key_id       = var.kms_key_arn  # optional if using the default AWS-managed key
}

resource "aws_ebs_encryption_by_default" "default_encryption" {
  enabled = true
}
```

- `encrypted = true` ensures encryption at rest.  
- `kms_key_id` is optional if you prefer AWS’s default KMS key (`alias/aws/ebs`).  
- Setting `aws_ebs_encryption_by_default` ensures **all new volumes** in the account are encrypted, even if a specific resource definition doesn’t specify encryption.

---

## 4. **Manual Remediation Steps**

### 4.1 Identify Unencrypted Resources

1. **AWS Console**: Go to **EC2 → Volumes**. Filter for **Encrypted = No**.  
2. **AWS CLI**:  
   ```bash
   aws ec2 describe-volumes --filters "Name=encrypted,Values=false"
   ```  
   This lists all unencrypted volumes.

### 4.2 Options to Encrypt Existing Snapshots/Volumes

When dealing with existing **unencrypted** volumes or snapshots, you have **two main approaches**:

---

#### **Method A: One-Step Encryption at Volume Creation**

If you just need an **encrypted volume** and **don’t** care about preserving an encrypted snapshot:

1. **Create or Launch an Encrypted Volume/Instance**  
   - In the **EC2 console**, when you **launch a new instance** or **create a new volume** from an **unencrypted** snapshot, select “Encrypt this volume” in the storage settings.  
   - Specify a KMS key if you don’t want the default key.  

2. **Attach or Launch**  
   - If launching an instance, the new root/data volume will be **encrypted** even though the snapshot was unencrypted.  
   - The snapshot remains **unencrypted** in your account unless you later copy it with encryption (optional).

**Pros**: Quick and easy if you only need the final volume encrypted.  
**Cons**: You still have an unencrypted snapshot in your environment unless you later remove or re-copy it.

---

#### **Method B: Two-Step Snapshot Copy with Encryption**

If you **want or need an encrypted snapshot** (for compliance or future reuse):

1. **Copy the Unencrypted Snapshot**  
   - In the **EC2 → Snapshots** console, select the unencrypted snapshot and click **Copy**.  
   - Check “Encrypt this copy” and choose your KMS key. A new **encrypted snapshot** is created.

2. **Create a Volume from the Encrypted Snapshot**  
   - Once the encrypted snapshot is ready, create a new volume from it.  
   - This volume is fully encrypted at rest.

3. **Attach/Replace Existing Volume**  
   - If replacing an unencrypted volume on an instance, detach the old one and attach the newly encrypted one.  
   - After confirming the new volume is working correctly, delete the old unencrypted volume (and if desired, the old unencrypted snapshot).

**Pros**: You end up with a permanent **encrypted snapshot**, ensuring your entire snapshot library is secure.  
**Cons**: Requires an extra step to copy snapshots.

---

### 4.3 Detach & Replace (If Migrating a Live Instance)

For root volumes or in-use data volumes:
1. **Stop** the EC2 instance (if the volume is root).  
2. **Detach** the old unencrypted volume (for data volumes).  
3. **Attach** the newly created encrypted volume to the instance.  
4. **Start** the instance and verify normal functionality.  
5. **Delete** the unencrypted volume once the new volume is confirmed working.

---

## 5. **SCP Enforcement** (Optional)

If you want to prevent **any** unencrypted volumes from being created across all accounts, you can create a **Service Control Policy (SCP)** in AWS Organizations:

```json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Sid": "DenyUnencryptedEBS",
      "Effect": "Deny",
      "Action": [
        "ec2:CreateVolume",
        "ec2:ModifyVolume"
      ],
      "Resource": "*",
      "Condition": {
        "BoolIfExists": {
          "ec2:Encrypted": "false"
        }
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

- This will **block** any attempt to create or modify a volume without encryption.  
- Test it in **non-production** first to ensure no legacy processes rely on unencrypted volumes.

---

## 6. **Verification**

### 6.1 AWS Console

1. **EC2 → Volumes**: Confirm the **Encrypted** column shows “**Yes**.”  
2. **EC2 → Snapshots**: If you used Method B, confirm your new snapshot is marked as “Encrypted: **Yes**.”

### 6.2 AWS CLI

```bash
aws ec2 describe-volumes --volume-ids vol-xxxxxxx
```
Check for:
```json
"Volumes": [
  {
    "VolumeId": "vol-xxxxxxx",
    "Encrypted": true,
    "KmsKeyId": "arn:aws:kms:..."
  }
]
```

### 6.3 Orca or Other Scanners

- Confirm that **CBC-AWS-EBS-2** alerts for unencrypted volumes are **no longer** flagged for your environment.  
- Some tools may also provide an auto-rescan or compliance check to verify newly created resources are encrypted.
