**Title**  
Investigate Direct Internet Routes in Azure SQL MI Subnets

---

**Description**  
Weâ€™ve identified several User-Defined Routes (UDRs) in our Azure environment (particularly on SQL Managed Instance subnets) that direct traffic to the Internet. This may bypass our on-premises BGP-based outbound restrictions and external firewall.  
   
**Tasks**  
1. Gather details on existing UDRs and associated subnets.  
2. Confirm how current BGP routing is meant to block or control internet egress.  
3. Determine whether these UDRs override BGP and if traffic is truly bypassing our firewall.  
4. Provide recommendations and next steps for remediation or policy updates.

**Acceptance Criteria**  
- **Documentation**: A clear inventory of the UDRs and the subnets they affect.  
- **BGP Review**: Confirmation from the Network SME on whether our BGP config is intended to block internet access for these subnets.  
- **Risk Assessment**: Verification that these UDRs effectively bypass our on-prem firewall, and an outline of potential impacts.  
- **Remediation Plan**: Proposed actions (e.g., removing/adjusting UDRs, implementing firewall rules, or updating Azure Policy) with sign-off from relevant stakeholders.
