**Subject:** Requesting Network SME Input: Potential UDR Bypass & BGP Configuration Concerns

Hello [Name of SME],

I hope you’re doing well. I’m reaching out regarding some user-defined route (UDR) configurations in our Azure environment—specifically within certain SQL Managed Instance subnets—that appear to route traffic directly to the Internet. My concerns are:

1. **Potential Bypass of On-Prem Firewall**  
   - Our current stance is that outbound traffic to the Internet should be controlled or blocked at the on-premises firewall via BGP routing.  
   - However, these custom UDRs (with “Internet” as the next hop or specific external IP prefixes) might override the usual BGP routing, effectively bypassing our external firewall.

2. **Verification of BGP Blocking**  
   - I’d like to confirm whether our on-premises BGP configuration is indeed set to block or control internet-bound traffic from these subnets.  
   - If so, these custom UDRs could be creating exceptions that undermine our security posture.

3. **Risk Assessment**  
   - Because this is a banking environment, we want to ensure there’s no unmonitored path to the Internet.  
   - Could you help confirm if traffic from these subnets is fully bypassing the firewall, or if there are any additional measures in place?

**Ask:**
- From your perspective, does our BGP routing intentionally block all internet egress unless otherwise routed?  
- Can you verify if these Azure UDRs are indeed circumventing BGP and sending traffic directly out to the Internet?  
- Are there any historical reasons or exceptions that might explain these routes?

I’d greatly appreciate your expertise here. Once we have clarity, we can plan next steps—whether that’s adjusting the UDRs, routing everything through a firewall, or documenting why these exceptions exist.

Please let me know your thoughts at your earliest convenience. I’ve cc’d [Manager/Team] for visibility.

Thank you in advance for your help.

Kind regards,
