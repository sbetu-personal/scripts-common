**Subject:** Re: BGP Routes Information – Next Steps & Call Request

Hi [Network SME Name],

Thanks for providing the BGP routes information. Given that we now have a clearer picture of our current routing at the ExpressRoute edge, I’d like to schedule a brief call to discuss next steps for addressing the UDR configurations inside Azure. It will be helpful to have you on the call to confirm that any changes we make won’t conflict with or require updates on your side.

Could you please let me know a few time slots in the next few days that work for you? I’ll coordinate with the Azure team and send out a meeting invite.

Thank you again for your assistance.

Best regards,
