**Subject:** Re: Azure SQL MI Subnets – Outbound Traffic & Upcoming Audit/Logging Change

Hi [DB SME Name],

Thank you for clarifying the previous changes around public endpoints. Disabling the public endpoint indeed prevents external parties from directly accessing these SQL Managed Instances over the internet; however, as you noted, the concern now is primarily about **outbound** egress via the UDRs. Even if no inbound connectivity is allowed, the Managed Instances (or underlying VMs) could still send data out to the internet if the routes permit it—which raises a potential security gap until we decommission or reconfigure them.

In light of this:

1. **Upcoming Audit/Logging Update**  
   - On Monday, we’re enabling SQL audit and logging as part of our plan to identify unused databases. This will also help us spot any unusual activity—particularly relevant now that we know outbound internet access is technically possible on these subnets.

2. **Decommission Timeline**  
   - Since these instances are slated for retirement, we’ll keep the logging and auditing in place to ensure security oversight until everything is fully migrated.  
   - As we review logs, we might catch any references or calls that indicate outbound connectivity.

3. **Next Steps**  
   - I’ll collaborate with the network team to see if we can safely remove or reroute the UDRs without impacting any existing processes.  
   - If you or anyone else recalls further details on why these routes were created, please let me know so we don’t accidentally break a needed workflow.

I appreciate your input and will keep you and the rest of the team updated as we learn more from the audit logs. If you have any questions about Monday’s change or the UDR review, feel free to let me know.

Thanks again,

Hi [DB SME Name],

Thanks for sharing your recollection about the past networking changes for these SQL Managed Instances. Disabling public endpoints certainly helps block direct inbound access from the internet. However, as you mentioned, there’s still a chance for outbound data to reach the internet if the UDRs allow it—so that’s our main concern right now.

Just a heads-up: on **Monday**, we’re moving forward with enabling SQL audit and logging. While the original goal was to identify unused databases, this also gives us much-needed visibility into any unusual outbound activity, especially given what we’ve found with these UDRs.

If you have any additional details or remember anything else about why the routes were set up this way, please let me know—it’ll help us avoid breaking something accidentally. In the meantime, I’ll keep you and the team in the loop on anything we uncover once the audit logs are in place.

Thanks again for your input.
