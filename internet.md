**Subject:** Unable to Access Internet from Azure Bash Shell

---

**Dear Azure Support Team,**

I am experiencing an issue where the internet is inaccessible from the Azure Bash shell (Azure Cloud Shell) in the Azure Portal.

**Issue Details:**
- **Subscription ID:** `[Your Subscription ID]`
- **Resource Group:** `[Your Resource Group Name]`
- **Cloud Shell Region:** `[e.g., East US]`
- **Issue Onset:** `[e.g., January 15, 2025, 10:00 AM UTC]`

**Symptoms:**
- Commands like `curl` and `ping` fail with errors such as:
  - `curl: (7) Failed to connect to www.google.com port 443: Connection timed out`
  - `ping: www.google.com: Temporary failure in name resolution`

**Troubleshooting Steps Taken:**
1. Verified that I am using Azure Cloud Shell.
2. Checked Network Security Groups (NSGs) to ensure outbound traffic on ports 80 and 443 is allowed.
3. Reviewed Azure Firewall settings and confirmed no restrictions.
4. Tested DNS resolution with `nslookup`, which appears functional.
5. Restarted the Cloud Shell environment.
6. Confirmed no service outages on the [Azure Status Page](https://status.azure.com/).

Despite these steps, the issue persists and is impacting my ability to perform essential tasks.

**Request:**
Could you please assist in diagnosing and resolving this connectivity issue?

Thank you for your support.

**Best regards,**

[Your Full Name]  
[Your Job Title]
