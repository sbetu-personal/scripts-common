Here's a draft email for your architect:

**Subject:** Request to Update "CBC AWS ECR-3: Repository Encryption" Policy  

Dear [Architect's Name],  

As discussed, regarding the "CBC AWS ECR-3: Repository Encryption with KMS" policy, you agreed to revise it to allow **any encryption method** instead of restricting it to only KMS.  

Could you kindly make this change in the CBC at the earliest? This will ensure the Orca team can update their policy accordingly.  

Please let me know once the changes are implemented or if you need any additional inputs.  

Best regards,  
[Your Name]

Feel free to customize further if needed!
