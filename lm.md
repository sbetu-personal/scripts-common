**Preparing VPC Lambda for Apigee**

I need to guide the user through creating a new Lambda with VPC integration to test connectivity to Apigee in GCP. The user’s setup includes direct connectors between on-prem, AWS, and GCP. First, I'll check if the GCP Apigee endpoint is public or private. Then, I'll determine the right subnets (private or public) and ensure that the Lambda has the proper route for connectivity. This will involve setting up security groups, route tables, NAT Gateway, and ensuring DNS resolution works. Let’s also confirm security requirements.

**Creating Lambda with VPC Configuration**

To test connectivity to Apigee, we need to create a Lambda inside a VPC. The user should decide whether to use a public or private subnet and ensure NAT gateway or Transit Gateway is set up for outbound traffic. Key steps include gathering prerequisites (Apigee information, IAM role), choosing subnets, setting up route tables, and deploying the Lambda with appropriate permissions. We can also explore using Systems Manager or Reachability Analyzer instead of Lambda for testing. Following this, the guide covers deployment, validation, and cleanup.

**Searching for documentation**

The user wants a step-by-step guide, and I think I should rely on up-to-date documentation to ensure accuracy, especially for details on Lambda VPC configuration. Given the potential for changes, I’ll look up relevant AWS resources (like Lambda with VPC, NAT Gateway configurations, and security groups) and also check out how to use AWS Reachability Analyzer for connectivity. I might browse for the latest AWS docs to cite them properly, just to be safe. No immediate news needed here, but citations are important.


**Considering documentation update**

The user needs a step-by-step guide, and while I can rely on current internal knowledge, fetching up-to-date documents will ensure I provide the most accurate details. AWS documentation hasn't changed drastically, but it’s safer to check for updates, especially regarding Lambda VPC configuration, NAT Gateway setup, and connectivity testing tools. I'll gather references from official docs to ensure accuracy and provide proper citations, just in case anything has changed.


**Focusing on citations and guide**

To ensure we have accurate details, we should reference sections about network configurations, including port 443 for Apigee and VPC peering. We likely don’t need many sources beyond AWS documentation for Lambda VPC connectivity and NAT Gateway specifics. I’ll also mention AWS Reachability Analyzer for testing connectivity. Given the user's environment, I'll focus my guide on setting up subnets with the proper outbound connectivity, so the new Lambda can successfully communicate with Apigee without breaking connectivity.


**Optimizing network configuration**

If the Apigee endpoint is public, I need to ensure that the NAT Gateway is in a public subnet, ensuring that private subnets can route to it. I'll also make sure the security group allows port 443. For extra reliability, using static IP addresses (like Elastic IP or AWS Global Accelerator) might help. If it's private, and connected to GCP via Direct Connect or VPN, I will update the route table to include a path to GCP’s Apigee endpoint through on-prem connections or a Transit Gateway.

**Lambda setup and connectivity checks**

I should start by setting up a security group allowing outbound port 443 and inbound ephemeral traffic from Lambda, though inbound isn't strictly necessary. Then, I’ll configure the IAM role. I've already provided a sample code, but can improve it with the requests library.

After deploying, testing, and checking logs, I can optionally add an environment variable for the endpoint and use CloudWatch metrics for failure alerts. For path testing, AWS Reachability Analyzer can help with Lambda ENI to Apigee connectivity.


Thought for 1m 54s


Below is an end‑to‑end checklist you can follow the first time, and then keep as your run‑book whenever you have to plug a Lambda into a VPC and make sure it can still reach Apigee (or any external service).

## 0. Gather the facts first 🗒️

| What you need                                                                    | Why you need it                                                 | Example                                              |
| -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| **Apigee endpoint FQDN / IP**                                                    | Used in the test code and to build firewall/NACL rules          | `api.gcp‑acme.com`                                   |
| **Whether the endpoint is reached over public Internet or private interconnect** | Decides if you need a NAT Gateway or a TGW/Direct Connect route | *Public* in most Apigee SaaS orgs                    |
| **VPC & subnet(s) that already have outbound path**                              | Lambda ENIs must sit here                                       | `vpc‑prod‑us‑east‑1`, subnets `subnet‑a`, `subnet‑b` |
| **CIDRs reserved for GCP/Apigee if using private routing**                       | Needed for custom route tables                                  | `10.140.0.0/16`                                      |
| **IAM role name to run the test**                                                | Lambda permissions & VPC ENI creation                           | `lambda‑apigee‑check‑role`                           |
| **Security‑group egress policy**                                                 | Must allow TCP 443 to Apigee range or 0.0.0.0/0                 | Outbound TCP 443                                     |

*(If any of these are unknown, stop and confirm first—most “it suddenly stopped working” tickets happen right here.)*

---

## 1. Make sure the VPC has a viable egress path

1. **If the call goes over the public Internet**

   * Put the Lambda in **private subnets**.
   * Verify the subnet route table contains `0.0.0.0/0 → NAT Gateway`.
   * Ensure the NAT Gateway itself sits in a public subnet with an Internet Gateway.  ([AWS Documentation][1], [AWS Documentation][2])

2. **If the call goes through Direct Connect / VPN / TGW**

   * Make sure the subnet route table has a route for the Apigee CIDR (for example `10.140.0.0/16 → tgw‑xxxx`).
   * Confirm the on‑prem firewall allows the source IPs of your private subnets (or of the NAT, if you still use one) to reach Apigee on TCP 443.

> **Tip:** If you aren’t sure, the VPC Reachability Analyzer will tell you whether traffic from “Lambda ENI” → “Internet GW” (or → “Transit GW”) is actually possible before you ever run the function. ([Amazon Web Services, Inc.][3])

---

## 2. Create or reuse the IAM execution role

```bash
aws iam create-role \
  --role-name lambda-apigee-check-role \
  --assume-role-policy-document file://trust-lambda.json

aws iam attach-role-policy \
  --role-name lambda-apigee-check-role \
  --policy-arn arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/service-role/AWSLambdaVPCAccessExecutionRole
```

Add any account‑specific policies you need for CloudWatch Logs or Secrets Manager (for example, to pull a client ID/secret).

---

## 3. Author the tiny test function

```python
import os, json, time, urllib3

http = urllib3.PoolManager()
APIGEE_URL = os.getenv("APIGEE_URL")

def lambda_handler(event, context):
    started = time.time()
    try:
        r = http.request("GET", APIGEE_URL, timeout=5.0)
        latency_ms = int((time.time() - started) * 1000)
        body = {
            "status": r.status,
            "latency_ms": latency_ms
        }
        print(json.dumps(body))
        return body
    except Exception as e:
        print("Error:", e)
        raise
```

Upload as a ZIP or paste it straight into the console.
Set environment variable `APIGEE_URL=https://api.gcp‑acme.com/ping` (use a lightweight “ping” resource if you have one).

---

## 4. Deploy the function with a VPC configuration

1. **Console path**: *Lambda → Create function* → “Advanced settings” → **Enable VPC**.
2. Choose **your VPC** and **two private subnets** in different AZs.
3. Select (or create) a **security group** that allows *outbound TCP 443* (no inbound rules are required).
4. Attach the **IAM role** you created above.
5. Click **Create/Save**.

AWS immediately provisions ENIs into each chosen subnet; this is why the role needs `ec2:CreateNetworkInterface`.  ([AWS Documentation][1])

---

## 5. Dry‑run the connectivity test

* In the Lambda console, press **Test** with an empty event.
* **Success looks like** a JSON response such as `{"status":200,"latency_ms":123}` in < 1 s.
* **Failure** — you will either see a timeout (most common: no NAT/route) or a 4xx/5xx from Apigee (TLS, firewall, or proxy issue).

When it fails, work backwards:

| Symptom                       | Quick check                                                                                |
| ----------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Task timed out**            | Route table or NAT missing; subnet can’t reach 0.0.0.0/0                                   |
| **`Hostname not known`**      | VPC DNS disabled; verify “Enable DNS hostnames/resolution” in VPC                          |
| **TLS handshake fails / 502** | Google Cloud Armor / Apigee firewall rule; see Apigee routing playbook ([Google Cloud][4]) |

---

## 6. Automate and monitor (optional but recommended)

* **CloudWatch Logs** – add a Metric Filter on `status != 200` and an Alarm to an SNS topic.
* **Schedule** – create an EventBridge rule to invoke the test every few minutes until you finish migrating the production Lambda, then disable it.
* **Reachability Analyzer** – keep a saved path from the Lambda subnet ENI to the IGW/TGW so you can rerun it after every route‑table change.

---

## 7. Cut‑over checklist for the real Lambda

1. Tag or snapshot the current function in case you need to roll back.
2. Apply **the same VPC, subnets & SG** you just validated.
3. Watch CloudWatch Logs; you should see the same 200‑status results.
4. If everything is green for 24 h, decommission the test function (or keep it as a canary).

---

### Alternative approaches (if Lambda isn’t convenient)

| Option                                     | When to use                                                                                      |
| ------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **AWS Network Reachability Analyzer only** | You just need to confirm routing/Security Groups, not application‑level TLS.                     |
| **Fargate “curl” task**                    | Need to test from a container that mimics what your app does (mTLS, custom cipher suites, etc.). |
| **On‑prem or GCP to AWS test**             | Reverse path testing if you also need to ensure Apigee can call back to AWS.                     |

---

### Cleanup

```bash
aws lambda delete-function --function-name apigee-vpc-probe
aws iam detach-role-policy --role-name lambda-apigee-check-role \
  --policy-arn arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/service-role/AWSLambdaVPCAccessExecutionRole
aws iam delete-role --role-name lambda-apigee-check-role
```

*(Or keep the function disabled so you can reuse it for future VPC migrations.)*

---

#### You’re all set!

Run through this playbook once, capture the exact subnet IDs and SG IDs that work, and the move to a VPC‑attached production Lambda becomes a low‑risk change instead of a leap of faith.
