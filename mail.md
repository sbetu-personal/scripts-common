Subject: Introducing Azure Infrastructure Code for Orca Project â€“ Request for Review

Hi team,

I hope you're all doing well.

As you know, I've been working on setting up the infrastructure for the Orca project on Azure. Since our team mainly works with AWS, I wanted to share what I've put together so far for Azure.

I've developed the necessary Terraform modules and environment configurations, and everything is currently in a single repository called **"azure-infra"** in our sandbox environment. I'll be testing this in our Azure sandbox subscription.

I would really appreciate it if you could take a look at the code when you have some time. Your feedback will be valuable to ensure we're on the right track and aligning with our team's standards.

Please let me know if you have any questions or if you'd like to discuss anything in detail.

Thanks, and I'm looking forward to your input!
