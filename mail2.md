To determine the Azure roles you need based on your Terraform code, let's analyze the resources you're creating and the permissions required to manage them.

---

## **Resources Managed by Your Terraform Code**

Your Terraform configurations involve the creation and management of the following Azure resources:

1. **Resource Groups**
2. **Virtual Networks (VNets)**
3. **Subnets**
4. **Network Security Groups (NSGs)**
5. **NSG Security Rules**
6. **Route Tables**
7. **Routes within Route Tables**
8. **Associations between Subnets, NSGs, and Route Tables**

---

## **Permissions Required**

To execute your Terraform code successfully, you need permissions to perform the following actions:

### **1. Resource Group Management**

- **Create Resource Groups**
  - `Microsoft.Resources/subscriptions/resourceGroups/write`
- **Delete Resource Groups**
  - `Microsoft.Resources/subscriptions/resourceGroups/delete`
- **Read Resource Groups**
  - `Microsoft.Resources/subscriptions/resourceGroups/read`

### **2. Virtual Network (VNet) Management**

- **Create, Update, Delete VNets**
  - `Microsoft.Network/virtualNetworks/write`
  - `Microsoft.Network/virtualNetworks/delete`
- **Read VNets**
  - `Microsoft.Network/virtualNetworks/read`

### **3. Subnet Management**

- **Create, Update, Delete Subnets**
  - `Microsoft.Network/virtualNetworks/subnets/write`
  - `Microsoft.Network/virtualNetworks/subnets/delete`
- **Read Subnets**
  - `Microsoft.Network/virtualNetworks/subnets/read`

### **4. Network Security Group (NSG) Management**

- **Create, Update, Delete NSGs**
  - `Microsoft.Network/networkSecurityGroups/write`
  - `Microsoft.Network/networkSecurityGroups/delete`
- **Read NSGs**
  - `Microsoft.Network/networkSecurityGroups/read`

### **5. NSG Security Rules Management**

- **Create, Update, Delete NSG Rules**
  - `Microsoft.Network/networkSecurityGroups/securityRules/write`
  - `Microsoft.Network/networkSecurityGroups/securityRules/delete`
- **Read NSG Rules**
  - `Microsoft.Network/networkSecurityGroups/securityRules/read`

### **6. Route Table Management**

- **Create, Update, Delete Route Tables**
  - `Microsoft.Network/routeTables/write`
  - `Microsoft.Network/routeTables/delete`
- **Read Route Tables**
  - `Microsoft.Network/routeTables/read`

### **7. Route Management within Route Tables**

- **Create, Update, Delete Routes**
  - `Microsoft.Network/routeTables/routes/write`
  - `Microsoft.Network/routeTables/routes/delete`
- **Read Routes**
  - `Microsoft.Network/routeTables/routes/read`

### **8. Associations**

- **Associate NSGs and Route Tables with Subnets**
  - `Microsoft.Network/virtualNetworks/subnets/join/action`

### **9. General Read Permissions**

- **Read Network Resources**
  - `Microsoft.Network/*/read`

---

## **Azure Built-in Roles Analysis**

Based on the permissions required, here are the Azure built-in roles that could grant you the necessary access:

### **1. Network Contributor**

- **Scope**: Provides access to manage network resources, but does **not** include permissions to create or delete Resource Groups.
- **Permissions**:
  - All actions on network resources: `Microsoft.Network/*`
- **Limitations**:
  - Cannot create or delete Resource Groups (`Microsoft.Resources/subscriptions/resourceGroups/*`).

### **2. Contributor**

- **Scope**: Grants full access to manage all Azure resources, including the ability to create and delete Resource Groups, but does **not** allow managing access permissions.
- **Permissions**:
  - All actions except role assignments: `*/read`, `*/write`, `*/delete`
- **Advantages**:
  - Includes permissions to create, update, and delete Resource Groups.
- **Considerations**:
  - Broad permissions; may exceed the principle of least privilege if assigned at the subscription level.

### **3. Owner**

- **Scope**: Full access to all resources, including the ability to delegate access to others.
- **Permissions**:
  - All permissions granted by the Contributor role, plus the ability to manage role assignments.
- **Considerations**:
  - Typically reserved for administrators; may be more access than necessary.

---

## **Recommendation**

Given that you need to create and delete Resource Groups and manage network resources, the **Contributor** role is the most appropriate built-in role to assign.

### **Option 1: Assign the Contributor Role**

- **Action**: Request to be assigned the Contributor role at the **subscription** or **resource group** level in the Azure Sandbox environment.
- **Advantages**:
  - Provides all the permissions needed to execute your Terraform code.
  - Simplifies permissions management by using a built-in role.
- **Potential Concerns**:
  - May grant more permissions than necessary if assigned at a broad scope.

### **Option 2: Create a Custom Role with Specific Permissions**

If granting the Contributor role is not feasible due to security policies, you can request a custom role with the exact permissions required.

#### **Custom Role Permissions**

Here's a JSON definition of the permissions you would need in a custom role:

```json
{
  "Name": "Orca Project Custom Role",
  "IsCustom": true,
  "Description": "Custom role for managing resources required by the Orca project.",
  "Actions": [
    // Resource Group permissions
    "Microsoft.Resources/subscriptions/resourceGroups/read",
    "Microsoft.Resources/subscriptions/resourceGroups/write",
    "Microsoft.Resources/subscriptions/resourceGroups/delete",
    // VNet permissions
    "Microsoft.Network/virtualNetworks/*",
    // Subnet permissions
    "Microsoft.Network/virtualNetworks/subnets/*",
    // NSG permissions
    "Microsoft.Network/networkSecurityGroups/*",
    // NSG Security Rules
    "Microsoft.Network/networkSecurityGroups/securityRules/*",
    // Route Table permissions
    "Microsoft.Network/routeTables/*",
    // Route permissions
    "Microsoft.Network/routeTables/routes/*",
    // Association permissions
    "Microsoft.Network/virtualNetworks/subnets/join/action",
    // General read permissions
    "Microsoft.Network/*/read"
  ],
  "NotActions": [],
  "AssignableScopes": [
    "/subscriptions/YOUR_SUBSCRIPTION_ID"
  ]
}
```

- **Action**: Provide this custom role definition to your Azure administrator or manager and request that it be created and assigned to you at the appropriate scope.
- **Advantages**:
  - Adheres to the principle of least privilege by granting only the necessary permissions.
- **Considerations**:
  - Requires administrative effort to create and manage the custom role.

---

## **Next Steps**

1. **Discuss with Your Manager or Azure Administrator**

   - Explain the permissions you need based on the resources managed by your Terraform code.
   - Provide the analysis above to support your request.

2. **Choose the Appropriate Role Option**

   - **Contributor Role**: If acceptable within your organization's policies, this is the simplest solution.
   - **Custom Role**: If more granular control is required, proceed with creating a custom role.

3. **Update Your Access Permissions**

   - Once the role is assigned, verify that you can create and delete Resource Groups and manage network resources.

## **Email Draft to Your Manager**

You can use the following email to communicate your needs:

---

**Subject:** Request for Permissions to Manage Azure Resources for Orca Project

---

Dear [Manager's Name],

I hope you're doing well.

As I'm working on deploying the Azure infrastructure for the Orca project using Terraform, I've encountered some permission issues:

- **Current Limitations**: I can create network resources after being assigned the **Azure_Sandbox_int_Network_Admins** role via SailPoint, but I'm unable to delete Resource Groups that I create. This limitation hinders my ability to manage the infrastructure effectively.

- **Permissions Needed**: To execute the Terraform code successfully, I need permissions to create, update, and delete Resource Groups, as well as manage VNets, Subnets, NSGs, Route Tables, and their associations.

**Proposed Solutions:**

1. **Assign the Contributor Role**:

   - Grant me the built-in **Contributor** role at the subscription or resource group level in the Azure Sandbox environment.
   - This role includes all the necessary permissions to manage the resources required for the Orca project.

2. **Create a Custom Role**:

   - If assigning the Contributor role is not feasible, create a custom role with specific permissions.
   - I can provide a detailed list of the required permissions for the custom role.

Please let me know which option would be more appropriate, or if there's an alternative solution you recommend. Having the necessary permissions will enable me to proceed with the project efficiently.

Thank you for your support.

Best regards,

[Your Name]




Understood. Since you'll be creating more modules in the future and will likely need to manage additional types of Azure resources, it's important to ensure that your permissions accommodate both your current and future needs. This will prevent frequent interruptions to request additional permissions and allow you to work more efficiently.

---

## **Updated Analysis of Required Roles**

Given that your future modules may involve various Azure resources beyond networking components, such as:

- **Compute Resources**: Virtual Machines, Virtual Machine Scale Sets
- **Storage Accounts**
- **Databases**: Azure SQL, Cosmos DB
- **App Services**: Web Apps, Functions
- **Other PaaS and IaaS Resources**

You will need permissions to:

- **Create, Update, and Delete** these resources
- **Manage Resource Groups** effectively
- **Associate Resources** appropriately
- **Read and Write** permissions across multiple resource providers

---

## **Permissions Required**

### **1. Resource Group Management**

- **Create, Update, Delete Resource Groups**
  - `Microsoft.Resources/subscriptions/resourceGroups/*`

### **2. Full Resource Management Across Various Providers**

- **Compute**: `Microsoft.Compute/*`
- **Storage**: `Microsoft.Storage/*`
- **Web**: `Microsoft.Web/*`
- **Database**: `Microsoft.Sql/*`, `Microsoft.DocumentDB/*`
- **Networking**: `Microsoft.Network/*`
- **Other Providers**: Depending on future needs

### **3. General Permissions**

- **Read and Write** permissions for all necessary resource types
- **Ability to associate resources** (e.g., network interfaces to VMs)

---

## **Azure Built-in Roles Consideration**

### **1. **Contributor Role**

- **Scope**: Grants full access to manage all Azure resources, except for access management.
- **Permissions**: `*/read`, `*/write`, `*/delete`
- **Advantages**:
  - Provides comprehensive permissions needed for current and future tasks.
  - Eliminates the need to request additional permissions as you expand your work.
- **Considerations**:
  - Should be assigned at the appropriate scope (e.g., resource group or subscription level) to align with security policies.
  - For a sandbox environment, assigning at the subscription level may be acceptable.

### **2. **Owner Role**

- **Scope**: Full access to all resources, including the ability to delegate access.
- **Not Recommended**: Likely more access than needed and may conflict with organizational policies.

### **3. **Custom Role with Broad Permissions**

- **Scope**: Create a custom role that includes all necessary permissions across resource providers.
- **Considerations**:
  - More complex to maintain.
  - May still need updates as new resource types are introduced.
- **Recommendation**: Given the broad range of resources, a custom role might become as permissive as the Contributor role, so using the built-in Contributor role is more practical.

---

## **Recommendation**

**Request the Contributor Role at the Subscription Level in the Azure Sandbox Environment**

- **Rationale**:
  - Provides all the necessary permissions to manage current and future Azure resources.
  - Reduces administrative overhead and delays associated with incremental permission requests.
  - In a sandbox environment, the risk associated with broader permissions is mitigated.

---

## **Next Steps**

1. **Communicate with Your Manager**

   - Explain the necessity for broader permissions due to the scope of your work.
   - Highlight that the Contributor role will enable you to work efficiently without frequent permission changes.

2. **Prepare an Updated Email**

   - Clearly state your request and the reasons.
   - Assure adherence to security policies and responsible use of permissions.

## **Updated Email Draft to Your Manager**

**Subject:** Request for Contributor Role in Azure Sandbox Environment

---

Dear [Manager's Name],

I hope you're doing well.

As I continue developing the Azure infrastructure for the Orca project, I anticipate that I'll be creating additional modules involving a variety of Azure resources beyond networking components. This includes resources like Virtual Machines, Storage Accounts, Databases, and App Services.

Currently, my permissions allow me to create network resources, but I'm unable to perform other essential tasks such as deleting Resource Groups or managing compute and storage resources. This limitation is impacting my ability to effectively develop and test the infrastructure in our sandbox environment.

To efficiently manage the infrastructure and accommodate future expansion without the need for frequent permission updates, I would like to request the **Contributor** role at the **subscription level** within the Azure Sandbox environment. This role will grant me the necessary permissions to:

- Create, update, and delete a wide range of Azure resources
- Manage Resource Groups effectively
- Develop and test new modules without administrative delays

I understand the importance of adhering to security policies and the principle of least privilege. Given that the sandbox environment is isolated and used for development and testing purposes, I believe this level of access is appropriate and poses minimal risk.

Please let me know if this request is acceptable or if there's an alternative solution you recommend. Having the Contributor role will greatly enhance my ability to contribute effectively to the project and meet our development timelines.

Thank you for your consideration.

Best regards,

[Your Name]

## **Conclusion**

By obtaining the **Contributor** role at the subscription level in the Azure Sandbox environment, you'll have the flexibility and permissions needed to manage existing and future resources required for your work. This proactive approach will help you avoid delays associated with permission requests as you develop more modules.

---

**Additional Considerations**

- **Security Assurance**: Emphasize your commitment to using the permissions responsibly and adhering to all security policies.
- **Audit Logs**: Azure provides auditing capabilities; reassure your manager that all actions are logged and can be reviewed if necessary.
- **Alternative Scope**: If assigning the Contributor role at the subscription level is not feasible, consider requesting it at the Resource Group level for all Resource Groups you'll be working with.
