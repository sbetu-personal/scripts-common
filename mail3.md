Subject: Request for Permissions to Delete Resource Groups in Azure Sandbox

---

Hi [Manager's Name],

I'm encountering some permission issues while working on the Azure infrastructure for the Orca project in our sandbox environment.

Even after getting the **Azure_Sandbox_int_Network_Admins** role through SailPoint, I still can't delete the Resource Groups I create. This is limiting my ability to manage and clean up resources effectively.

It seems that both my current sysadmin role and the new network admin role have limitations regarding resource group deletion.

I noticed that there's no **Contributor** role available in SailPoint for the Azure Sandbox environment. The only other role I found is **Azure_Sandbox_Administrator**, which has Owner-level access but requires setting up an 'A' Account.

Would it be possible to either:

- Add a Contributor-like role in SailPoint for the Azure Sandbox environment that allows resource group deletion, or
- Provide me with the Azure_Sandbox_Administrator role and help set up an 'A' Account.

I think the first option might be simpler and would give me the necessary permissions without needing full owner access.

Please let me know what you think or if there's another solution.

Thanks for your help.

Best regards,

[Your Name]
