**Subject:** Addressing CBC-AWS-EBS-2: EBS Volume Encryption  

Dear [Architect's Name],  

I wanted to share my analysis and proposed plan regarding CBC-AWS-EBS-2: "EBS volume encryption must be enabled."  

### **Analysis Overview:**  
1. **Current Observations:**
   - Some volumes in AWS 1.0 are not encrypted, resulting in unencrypted backup snapshots.  
   - Certain CTX servers may require a review of their AMI images to ensure encryption is enabled by default.  

2. **Compliance for New Resources:**  
   - Our Terraform module already enforces encryption for new EC2 volumes, ensuring compliance moving forward.  

### **Proposed Plan for Existing Volumes:**  
Since encryption cannot be directly enabled for existing volumes, the suggested approach is:  
1. Create a snapshot of the unencrypted volume.  
2. Copy the snapshot with encryption enabled.  
3. Create a new encrypted volume from the encrypted snapshot.  
4. Replace the unencrypted volume with the new encrypted one and verify functionality.  

This process ensures compliance but may involve downtime, so it should be scheduled accordingly.  

### **Additional Suggestion: Service Control Policy (SCP):**  
To prevent unencrypted volumes from being created in the future (outside Terraform workflows), we could implement an SCP. This policy would enforce encryption at the account level by blocking the creation of unencrypted EBS volumes. Combined with enabling EBS encryption by default, this would help eliminate the risk of compliance gaps.  

Let me know if this approach aligns with our strategy or if you have additional recommendations.
