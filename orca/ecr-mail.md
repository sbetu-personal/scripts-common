**Subject:** Inquiry on CBC-AWS-ECR-3: Repository Encryption with KMS  

Dear [Architect's Name],  

I hope this email finds you well. I wanted to share my analysis and seek your input regarding the CBC-AWS-ECR-3 requirement: "Repository encryption must be enabled using KMS."  

**Analysis Overview:**  
- Based on my findings, 90% of these Orca alerts originate from ENTD AWS accounts.  
- By default, ECR repositories are encrypted using AES256, and the CBC enforces KMS as the mandatory encryption standard.  
- For newly created ECR repositories, our Terraform module already enforces KMS encryption successfully.  

**Challenge with Existing Repositories:**  
- Existing ECR repositories cannot have their encryption settings modified from AES256 to KMS.  
- Addressing this would require creating new repositories and migrating the existing images, which could be a complex and resource-intensive process.  

**Proposed Options:**  
1. Proceed with creating new repositories and migrating the images to comply with KMS encryption.  
2. Consider an exception for existing repositories, as they are already encrypted with AES256, ensuring a high level of security.  

Could you advise on whether we should proceed with the migration for existing repositories or explore the possibility of an exception? Your guidance will help us ensure compliance while balancing operational feasibility.  

Looking forward to your thoughts.
