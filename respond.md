**Subject:** OS Family Retirement Impact Analysis and Findings  

Dear [Manager's Name],  

Following the notification regarding the retirement of **OS Families 2, 3, and 4**, I have conducted an analysis of the Virtual Machines (VMs) across our subscriptions using Azure Resource Graph. Below are the key findings and next steps:  

---

### **Findings**  

1. **Total VMs Identified:**  
   - 66 VMs are present across all subscriptions.

2. **OS Information:**  
   - **61 VMs** are running **Windows Server 2012 R2** (OS Family 4).  
   - No VMs are running Windows Server 2008 R2 (OS Family 2) or Windows Server 2012 (OS Family 3).

3. **Power States:**  
   - **12 VMs** are in a **PowerState/Deallocated** state.  
   - **4 VMs** are in a **Stopped** state.  
   - **5 VMs** are in a **PowerState/Deallocated** state with an **unknown Windows OS type**.  

4. **Observations:**  
   - Majority of the VMs (61 out of 66) are running on OS Family 4, which will be retired on **28 February 2025**.  
   - The 5 VMs with unknown OS require further verification or review of their source image plans or instance views.

### **Next Steps**  

1. **Plan Migration:**  
   - For the 61 VMs running Windows Server 2012 R2, we need to plan an upgrade or migration to a supported OS Family (e.g., Windows Server 2016 or 2019) before the **28 February 2025** deadline.

2. **Review Deallocated VMs:**  
   - Investigate the 5 deallocated VMs with unknown OS types to confirm their configurations and determine if they are still needed.

3. **Action on Stopped VMs:**  
   - Assess the 4 stopped VMs to determine if they should be upgraded or retired.

4. **Verify Compliance:**  
   - Ensure all active VMs comply with supported OS Families to avoid service disruption or compliance issues.

Please let me know if you would like me to prepare a detailed migration plan or coordinate with the respective resource owners for further action.
