**Email Draft:**

Subject: Mandatory S3 Server-Side Encryption Enforcement Update

Hello [Team/Name],

During our recent review of the Terraform configuration for our S3 buckets, we identified a potential loophole in the previous setup that could, under certain circumstances, result in an S3 bucket being created without server-side encryption. While our current AWS provider version and Terraform validations have effectively closed this loophole, itâ€™s important that we explicitly enforce proper encryption settings to maintain compliance and security standards.

To address this, we have:

- Strongly typed the `server_side_encryption_configuration` variable to ensure it cannot accept null or malformed values.
- Enhanced the validation logic to confirm that a valid `apply_server_side_encryption_by_default` rule is always present.

These changes guarantee that all newly created S3 buckets will have the required encryption in place and align with our internal security policies.

If you have any questions or need further details, please let me know.

Best regards,

[Your Name]

```
feat: enforce mandatory S3 server-side encryption with stricter variable typing and validation

- Convert `server_side_encryption_configuration` variable from `any` to a strongly typed object.
- Add validation to ensure a valid encryption rule is always present.
- Remove the possibility of deploying unencrypted S3 buckets.


chore: simplify encryption rule and enforce SSE configuration

- Changed encryption configuration from a list of rules to a single rule block, removing unnecessary dynamic blocks
- Strongly typed the server_side_encryption_configuration variable for stricter validation
- Validated allowed values for sse_algorithm (AES256, aws:kms, aws:kms:dsse)
- Documented changes in CHANGELOG.md following Keep a Changelog guidelines
- Deferred updating README.md, pending tf-docs usage per peer suggestion

```
