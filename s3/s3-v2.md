Ensuring Compliance with CBC-AWS-S3-1: Encrypting Amazon S3 Buckets and Objects

Author: [Your Name or Organization]

Introduction

Compliance with the CBC-AWS-S3-1 policy requires that all objects stored in Amazon S3 are secured with server-side encryption (SSE). Whether using AES-256 (SSE-S3) or AWS Key Management Service (SSE-KMS), encryption ensures data at rest is protected from unauthorized access and meets organizational security standards.

This article provides a clear, step-by-step guide to achieving compliance for both new and existing S3 objects. It also covers automation strategies, verification techniques, and methods to produce CSV reports that simplify auditing and ongoing compliance checks.

Objectives
	•	Enable default encryption on existing S3 buckets.
	•	Re-encrypt or replace existing unencrypted objects.
	•	Continuously monitor compliance through AWS services.
	•	Generate CSV reports to track and audit encryption status across multiple buckets.

Step 1: Auditing Your Environment
	1.	List All Buckets:
Begin by identifying all S3 buckets in your AWS account:

aws s3 ls


	2.	Check Bucket-Level Encryption:
Determine if a bucket enforces default server-side encryption:

aws s3api get-bucket-encryption --bucket <bucket-name>

If you see "SSEAlgorithm" specified, the bucket enforces encryption for new uploads. If no encryption configuration is returned, the bucket currently does not auto-encrypt new objects.

	3.	Identify Unencrypted Objects:
Objects existing before enabling default encryption remain unencrypted. To detect them:
	•	Manual Checks via AWS CLI: For smaller buckets, you can individually check object metadata:

aws s3api head-object --bucket <bucket-name> --key <object-key>

Review the ServerSideEncryption field. If absent or None, the object is unencrypted.

	•	S3 Inventory: For large-scale auditing, consider using S3 Inventory, which generates a report of all objects and their encryption statuses. Using this inventory can simplify identifying which objects need re-encryption.

Step 2: Enforcing Default Bucket Encryption

Set default encryption at the bucket level so that all newly uploaded objects are encrypted by default:
	•	AES-256 Encryption:

aws s3api put-bucket-encryption \
  --bucket <bucket-name> \
  --server-side-encryption-configuration '{
    "Rules": [
      {
        "ApplyServerSideEncryptionByDefault": {
          "SSEAlgorithm": "AES256"
        }
      }
    ]
  }'


	•	AWS KMS Encryption:

aws s3api put-bucket-encryption \
  --bucket <bucket-name> \
  --server-side-encryption-configuration '{
    "Rules": [
      {
        "ApplyServerSideEncryptionByDefault": {
          "SSEAlgorithm": "aws:kms",
          "KMSMasterKeyID": "<kms-key-id>"
        }
      }
    ]
  }'



Verify the configuration:

aws s3api get-bucket-encryption --bucket <bucket-name>

Step 3: Re-Encrypting Existing Objects

Enabling default encryption doesn’t retroactively encrypt old objects. You must re-upload them:
	•	For Smaller Buckets:

aws s3 cp s3://<bucket-name>/ s3://<bucket-name>/ --recursive --sse AES256

Or with KMS:

aws s3 cp s3://<bucket-name>/ s3://<bucket-name>/ --recursive --sse aws:kms --sse-kms-key-id <kms-key-id>


	•	For Larger Buckets:
Use S3 Batch Operations with a manifest file generated from an S3 Inventory report. This approach automates the re-encryption of millions of objects without manual iteration.

After re-encryption, verify:

aws s3api head-object --bucket <bucket-name> --key <object-key>

The ServerSideEncryption field should now indicate AES256 or aws:kms.

Step 4: Continuous Monitoring and Enforcement
	1.	AWS Config Rules:
Enable the s3-bucket-server-side-encryption-enabled rule in AWS Config to continuously monitor your buckets. If a bucket becomes non-compliant, AWS Config will alert you, and you can even enable automatic remediation.
	2.	Service Control Policies (SCPs):
If you operate within AWS Organizations, implement an SCP to prevent the creation of non-compliant buckets at the organizational level. This ensures future buckets are always encrypted.

Step 5: Auditing and Reporting with a Python Script

To streamline audits, you can generate a CSV report of buckets and their object encryption statuses. The following Python script:
	•	Lists S3 buckets in your account or reads from a specified list.
	•	Retrieves each object’s encryption status.
	•	Outputs the results to CSV for easy review and record-keeping.

Requirements:
	•	boto3 installed (pip install boto3)
	•	AWS credentials configured in your environment.

Script (s3_encryption_report.py):

import boto3
import csv
import sys
import argparse

def list_all_buckets(s3_client):
    response = s3_client.list_buckets()
    return [b['Name'] for b in response.get('Buckets', [])]

def list_objects_in_bucket(s3_client, bucket_name):
    objects = []
    paginator = s3_client.get_paginator('list_objects_v2')
    for page in paginator.paginate(Bucket=bucket_name):
        for obj in page.get('Contents', []):
            objects.append(obj['Key'])
    return objects

def check_bucket_encryption(s3_client, bucket_name, writer):
    try:
        objects = list_objects_in_bucket(s3_client, bucket_name)
        if not objects:
            writer.writerow([bucket_name, "", "No objects in bucket"])
            return
        for key in objects:
            head_response = s3_client.head_object(Bucket=bucket_name, Key=key)
            encryption = head_response.get('ServerSideEncryption', 'None')
            writer.writerow([bucket_name, key, encryption])
    except s3_client.exceptions.NoSuchBucket:
        writer.writerow([bucket_name, "", "Bucket does not exist or is not accessible"])
    except Exception as e:
        writer.writerow([bucket_name, "", f"Error retrieving objects: {e}"])

def main():
    parser = argparse.ArgumentParser(description="Generate an S3 encryption report.")
    parser.add_argument("--buckets", help="File containing bucket names (one per line). If not provided, all buckets are checked.")
    args = parser.parse_args()

    s3_client = boto3.client('s3')
    if args.buckets:
        with open(args.buckets, 'r') as f:
            buckets = [line.strip() for line in f if line.strip()]
    else:
        buckets = list_all_buckets(s3_client)

    writer = csv.writer(sys.stdout, lineterminator='\n')
    writer.writerow(["BucketName", "ObjectKey", "ServerSideEncryption"])

    for bucket in buckets:
        check_bucket_encryption(s3_client, bucket, writer)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()

Usage:
	•	To check all buckets in the account:

python3 s3_encryption_report.py > all_buckets_report.csv


	•	To check only buckets listed in my_buckets.txt:

python3 s3_encryption_report.py --buckets my_buckets.txt > selected_buckets_report.csv



Now you have a CSV file (.csv) containing each object’s encryption status, allowing for easy review in spreadsheets or other reporting tools.

Impact and Benefits
	•	Data Security:
Ensuring server-side encryption protects your data at rest, mitigating the risk of unauthorized access.
	•	Regulatory Compliance:
Aligning with CBC-AWS-S3-1 and similar requirements simplifies audits and helps demonstrate adherence to security policies.
	•	Operational Efficiency:
Leveraging S3 Batch Operations, AWS Config, and automated scripts reduces manual overhead and human error.
	•	Scalable Auditing and Reporting:
Generating CSV reports and integrating them with internal audit workflows or third-party tools enables continuous oversight and compliance verification.

Conclusion

By following the steps outlined above—enabling default bucket encryption, re-encrypting existing objects, setting up continuous compliance monitoring, and generating CSV-based encryption audits—you ensure that your AWS S3 environment meets the CBC-AWS-S3-1 requirements. This structured approach safeguards sensitive data, streamlines the compliance process, and provides the reporting capabilities needed for audits and long-term governance.
