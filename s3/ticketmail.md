Certainly! Here's a straightforward and human-friendly email template you can use to notify the owners about the publicly accessible S3 bucket as per CBC Orca policy:

**Subject:** Action Required: Publicly Accessible S3 Bucket Detected

**Hi [Recipient's Name],**

I hope you're well.

Our security team using **Orca Security** has found that an Amazon S3 bucket in the **DMZ Non-Prod** AWS account is **publicly accessible**. According to **CBC Orca policies**, this bucket should not be public and needs to be secured immediately to protect our data.

**What Needs to Be Done:**

1. **Make the Bucket Private:**
   - **Block Public Access:** Adjust the bucket settings to block all public access.
   - **Review Permissions:** Ensure that only authorized users and services can access the bucket by checking the bucket policies and ACLs.

2. **Confirm the Changes:**
   - Let us know once you've secured the bucket so we can verify everything is properly set.

**Not the Right Person?**

If you're not responsible for this bucket, please **forward this email** to the correct person or provide their contact information so they can address this issue.

**Deadline:**

Please address this by **[Insert Deadline, e.g., "End of Next Week"]** to comply with our security policies.

If you have any questions or need help, feel free to reach out to me or the **Cloud Security Team** at [cloud-security@yourcompany.com](mailto:cloud-security@yourcompany.com).

Thanks for your prompt attention to this!
